The Purple Air node server must be told which Purple Air devices it should
monitor.  To do that you need to enter Custom Parameters describing each 
device.

In the 'key' field put the name you want to use to identify the Purple Air device.  Don't use special characters and keep it under 14 characters long.

In the 'value' field put the sensor ID of the Purple Air device. This is typically just a number.

Example:

My Home:  345678
